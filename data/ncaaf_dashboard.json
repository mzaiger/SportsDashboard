"""
College Football Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls this week's schedule, broadcast network, team records, and the AP
Top 25 poll from ESPN's public (unofficial, no-key-required) scoreboard
and rankings APIs, ranks each matchup by a blend of combined AP rank,
combined win-rank, and posted spread, then attaches DraftKings / FanDuel
spread + moneyline odds from SharpAPI (via common.py). Exports everything
to data/ncaaf_dashboard.json for the static index.html front-end to
consume.

Previously this pulled from CollegeFootballData.com (CFBD), which
required its own API key and has a much tighter rate limit than ESPN's
public endpoint. CFBD is no longer used anywhere in this script.

Env vars required:
    SHARPAPI_KEY - key from https://sharpapi.io
    (no key needed for ESPN's public scoreboard/rankings endpoints)

Usage:
    python scripts/build_ncaaf_dashboard.py
    python scripts/build_ncaaf_dashboard.py --week 1 --year 2026
