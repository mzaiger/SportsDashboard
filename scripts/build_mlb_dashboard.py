"""
MLB Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls the day's schedule + broadcast + probable starting pitchers from
ESPN's public (unofficial, no-key-required) baseball scoreboard API, then
attaches DraftKings / FanDuel run-line (spread) + moneyline odds from
SharpAPI (via common.py). Exports everything to data/mlb_dashboard.json
for the static mlb.html front-end.

MLB plays every day (no bye weeks, no single "week N" concept), so unlike
build_dashboard.py (CFB) / build_nfl_dashboard.py (NFL) this script moves
one day at a time instead of one week at a time. To reuse the exact same
JSON shape and front-end/merge code those two already have (weeks -> days
-> time_slots -> games), each "week" entry in mlb_dashboard.json actually
holds exactly one calendar day, and the "week" number is that day's date
as an integer (YYYYMMDD, e.g. 20260815) rather than a real week number.
common.py's merge_weeks() and picks-store.js's filter/record helpers all
key off that same "week" field, so they work unchanged -- they just end
up merging/filtering by day instead of by week for MLB. mlb.html and
picks.html know to format that "week" number back into a date rather
than a "Week N" label (see formatMlbDayLabel() in picks-store.js).

Off-season handling: if today falls BEFORE the first date on ESPN's
calendar (leagues[].calendar), the build window snaps forward to that
first game date -- so as soon as ESPN publishes the next season's
calendar, the board centers on its first day instead of sitting blank
from the final out of the World Series until the eve of the new slate.
The check is against the season's FIRST calendar date only (never "the
next upcoming date"), since MLB's calendar is sparse and its remaining
future entries mid-season are postseason dates. See
resolve_effective_today() below.

The run line (MLB's version of a point spread) is almost always fixed at
+/-1.5 runs -- SharpAPI's own posted spread line is used as-is rather
than hardcoded, since alternate run lines do occasionally appear, but
+/-1.5 is what you should expect to see on nearly every game.

Env vars required:
    SHARPAPI_KEY - key from https://sharpapi.io
    (no key needed for ESPN's public scoreboard endpoint)
