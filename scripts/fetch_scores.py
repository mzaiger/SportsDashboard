Live score poller -- run hourly via .github/workflows/fetch-scores.yml.

Overlays home/away scores + game status onto the games already listed in
data/ncaaf_dashboard.json (CFB), data/nfl_dashboard.json (NFL),
data/mlb_dashboard.json (MLB), data/nba_dashboard.json (NBA),
data/ncaamb_dashboard.json (NCAAMB), and data/nhl_dashboard.json (NHL),
which build_ncaaf_dashboard.py / build_nfl_dashboard.py /
build_mlb_dashboard.py / build_nba_dashboard.py /
build_ncaamb_dashboard.py / build_nhl_dashboard.py produce once a day.
This script is intentionally lightweight and kept separate from those
daily builds: it does NOT touch odds, AP rankings, probable pitchers, or
Gemini predictions -- it just looks up each game's current score by the
same game id the daily build already assigned, and writes a small
overlay file, data/scores.json, that index.html / nfl.html / mlb.html /
nba.html / ncaamb.html / nhl.html / picks.html fetch and merge in
client-side. Keeping this separate means scores can refresh hourly (or
more) without hitting SharpAPI's or Gemini's much tighter rate limits.

Score sources (matched by the exact game id already in each dashboard for
NFL/MLB/NBA/NCAAMB/NHL; matched by team name + date for CFB -- see note below):
    CFB    - ESPN's public college-football scoreboard endpoint (no key
             required). Matched back to our game ids by fuzzy team-name
             matching (same matcher common.py uses for odds) plus date,
             since ESPN's own event ids don't line up with the CFBD-era
             ids some older stored games still carry. Switched from
             CFBD's /games endpoint specifically because CFBD only ever
             reports final scores -- no in-progress quarter/clock --
             while ESPN's status.type.shortDetail gives a real
             "8:42 - 3rd" while a game is live.
    NFL    - ESPN's public scoreboard endpoint (same one
             build_nfl_dashboard.py uses for schedule; no key required).
    MLB    - ESPN's public baseball scoreboard endpoint (same one
             build_mlb_dashboard.py uses for schedule; no key required).
             Matched directly by event id, same as NFL, since
             build_mlb_dashboard.py's game ids already come from ESPN.
    NBA    - ESPN's public basketball scoreboard endpoint (same one
             build_nba_dashboard.py uses for schedule; no key required).
             Matched directly by event id, day-based like MLB.
    NCAAMB - ESPN's public men's-college-basketball scoreboard endpoint
             (same one build_ncaamb_dashboard.py uses for schedule; no
             key required). Matched directly by event id, day-based like
             MLB/NBA.
    NHL    - ESPN's public hockey scoreboard endpoint (same one
             build_nhl_dashboard.py uses for schedule; no key required).
             Matched directly by event id, day-based like MLB/NBA/NCAAMB.

Env vars required: none -- all six sources use ESPN's public endpoints.
