"""
NBA Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls the day's schedule + broadcast + team records from ESPN's public
(unofficial, no-key-required) basketball scoreboard API, then attaches
DraftKings / FanDuel spread + moneyline odds from SharpAPI (via
common.py). Exports everything to data/nba_dashboard.json for the static
nba.html front-end.

Like MLB, the NBA plays most days of the week (no real "week N" concept
during the regular season), so this script -- like
build_mlb_dashboard.py -- moves one calendar day at a time instead of one
week at a time. To reuse the exact same JSON shape and front-end/merge
code CFB/NFL/MLB already share (weeks -> days -> time_slots -> games),
each "week" entry in nba_dashboard.json actually holds exactly one
calendar day, and the "week" number is that day's date as an integer
(YYYYMMDD) rather than a real week number. See build_mlb_dashboard.py's
own module docstring for the full rationale -- this script follows it
exactly.

Unlike MLB's run line (nearly always a fixed +/-1.5), an NBA point spread
varies meaningfully game to game, so the matchup score blends 50% posted
spread + 50% combined win-rank (teams ranked by this season's record),
the same blend build_nfl_dashboard.py uses for its own (non Chiefs/Broncos)
games.

Off-season handling: if today falls BEFORE the first date on ESPN's
calendar (leagues[].calendar), the build window snaps forward to that
first game date -- so as soon as ESPN publishes the new season's
schedule, the board centers on opening night instead of sitting blank
from the Finals until the day before tip-off. See
resolve_effective_today() below.

Env vars required:
    SHARPAPI_KEY - key from https://sharpapi.io
    (no key needed for ESPN's public scoreboard endpoint)

Usage:
