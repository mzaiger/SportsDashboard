NFL Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls this week's schedule + national broadcast network from ESPN's public
(unofficial, no-key-required) scoreboard API, then attaches DraftKings /
FanDuel spread + moneyline odds from SharpAPI (via common.py). Exports
everything to data/nfl_dashboard.json for the static nfl.html front-end.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION -- read before trusting the "regional_pick" field:
This script does NOT scrape 506sports.com's regional coverage maps. Those
pages build their market-by-market data client-side in JavaScript (a plain
HTTP GET returns an empty shell -- confirmed by hand while building this),
so a `requests`-based script can't read them, and neither could a plain
Python script Marc runs elsewhere. See README.md for what was tried and
what a real fix would require (a headless-browser scraper).

Instead, `regional_pick` is a HEURISTIC guess at what airs in the Omaha /
Lincoln, NE market: when a CBS or FOX window has more than one game, it
picks whichever game features the Kansas City Chiefs, then the Denver
Broncos (both have historically been the closest teams to that market).
This is NOT authoritative -- always cross-check at 506sports.com before
relying on it.

Env vars required:
    SHARPAPI_KEY - key from https://sharpapi.io
    (no key needed for ESPN's public scoreboard endpoint)

    happening -- most likely during a multi-day gap between two weeks,
    when "today" has no games of its own for ESPN to resolve "current"
    against):

    1. Floor check (earliest_unelapsed_stored_week): if a LATER week is

       current_week this exact season_type was already confirmed at on a
       previous run -- weeks only move forward during a season.
    3. Elapsed-kickoff bump: if every game in the highest-numbered stored

       bump forward -- gated to the SAME season_type as what's already
       stored, so a postseason-to-preseason transition (where week
       numbers reset low, e.g. Super Bowl week ~4 vs. preseason week 1)
       can't misfire and invent a nonsensical "week N" that was never
