Gemini prediction helper, shared by build_ncaaf_dashboard.py (CFB),
build_nfl_dashboard.py (NFL), build_mlb_dashboard.py (MLB),
build_nba_dashboard.py (NBA), and build_ncaamb_dashboard.py (NCAAMB).

For every game that has at least one posted line (DraftKings or FanDuel,
spread or moneyline), asks Gemini for:
- a straight-up winner pick
- an ATS pick
- a 1-100 confidence score for the straight-up winner
- a 0-100 confidence score for the ATS pick
- a five-sentence explanation

Uses only current-season data.

Model fallback chain (tried top to bottom, falling back immediately
whenever a model reports itself rate-limited, over quota, or otherwise
unavailable -- see GEMINI_MODELS / _call_gemini):
    1. gemini-3.5-flash-lite
    2. gemini-3.1-flash-lite
    3. gemini-2.5-flash-lite
    4. gemini-2.0-flash-lite

Rate limiting:
- 1 API call every 10 seconds (6/minute)
- non-rate-limit errors (network errors, 5xx, an unusable response) retry
  the SAME model, waiting a full minute between attempts
- a rate limit / quota / not-found response (4xx) on any given model is
  NOT retried -- it falls straight through to the next model in the
  chain instead
- games are processed sequentially, one at a time
- if every model in the chain is rate-limited/unavailable for a given
  call, the run stops calling immediately; uncalled games are picked up
  on the next run (the cache preserves progress)

Caching:
Predictions are cached in data/gemini_predictions_cache.json, keyed by a
hash of (fallback-chain version, sport, season, week, matchup, DK odds,
FD odds) -- NOT by which specific model in the chain actually answered a
given call, so a game that happened to fall back to gemini-2.5-flash-lite
one run still hits the cache normally on the next run even if
gemini-3.5-flash-lite is healthy again by then. Changing the chain itself
(GEMINI_MODELS) invalidates every cached prediction, same as changing
models used to under the old single-model scheme.

Weekly full-refresh schedule:
- NFL: every Wednesday (UTC), the cache is ignored entirely for every
  NFL game that HASN'T already started -- each gets a fresh call
  regardless of whether its odds hash matches an existing cache entry.
  Games already underway or final are left completely alone (see
  skip_ids below), so a Wednesday refresh mid-week never touches a
  game that's already been decided. This happens ONCE per UTC calendar
  day, not once per run -- the odds workflow runs every 4 hours, so
  without tracking this, a Wednesday would force-refresh 6 times
  instead of 1. See _already_refreshed_today/_mark_refreshed_today.
- CFB: same, but on Thursday (UTC) instead of Wednesday, also once per
  day.
- MLB/NBA/NCAAMB: no scheduled full-refresh day -- caching behaves as
  described above on every day of the week for these three.
Any day that isn't that sport's refresh day, or any run after the first
one that day, caching works as described above (reuse whenever the odds
hash matches).

Env var required: GEMINI_KEY.
If missing, predictions are skipped entirely.

How to read "Home spread": it is the home team's own line, signed for the
home team (for MLB this is the run line, almost always +/-1.5 runs). A
negative number means the home team is favored by that many {margin_unit};
a positive number means the home team is the underdog by that many
{margin_unit}. The away team's line is always the exact opposite sign of
the same number.

Example: "Home spread: -1.5" means the home team is favored by 1.5 {margin_unit}.
The home team covers ONLY if it wins by MORE than that margin -- winning by
exactly that margin is a push (rare for a MLB run line, since half-run
lines can't push), winning by less or losing outright means the away team
covers instead, at the positive number.

Do not default to picking the favorite to cover just because it is
favored. Weigh current-season performance to judge whether the expected
margin is actually larger or smaller than the number above -- the
underdog covers any time the actual margin comes in under that number,
including if the underdog wins outright.

Using ONLY statistics, injuries, roster status, and performance from the
{season} season, determine:

1. Who wins outright.
2. Who covers the spread (only if a spread is posted above; otherwise
   null). Answer with the exact team name only, written exactly as it
   appears above under "Away Team"/"Home Team" -- do not append the line
   number or a "+"/"-" sign to it.
3. A confidence score from 1-100 for the outright winner pick.
4. A confidence score from 0-100 for the ATS pick.
5. A five-sentence explanation of the reasoning.
6. What percentage of bets (or bet count) is going to each side of the
   spread and each side of the moneyline, and which direction the spread
   and moneyline have moved from their opening numbers -- in exactly two
   sentences.

Ignore previous seasons, franchise history, and reputation -- current-season
data only.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these keys:
- "winner": string
- "confidence": integer 1-100
- "ats_pick": string or null -- the exact team name only (as written
  above under "Away Team"/"Home Team"), never the team name plus the
  line number
- "ats_confidence": integer 0-100
- "analysis": string with exactly five sentences
- "splits_and_direction": string with exactly two sentences covering the
  spread/moneyline betting percentage splits between the two teams and
  which direction each line has moved

If no spread is posted, set "ats_pick" to JSON null and "ats_confidence" to 0.
Do not put the word "null" in quotes.
If betting-splits data is not available to you, give your best estimate
based on the odds and public tendencies and say so briefly rather than
leaving the field empty.

    sequentially (~1/min per model, falling back through GEMINI_MODELS on
    a rate limit -- see _call_gemini) for new/changed games, then saves
    the cache. If every model in the chain is rate-limited/unavailable
    mid-slate, stops calling and leaves the rest for a future run.

    skip_ids, if given, is a set of game ids (as strings) to leave
    completely untouched -- no cache lookup, no Gemini call, no
    force-refresh override even on that sport's scheduled refresh day.
    The caller is expected to have already set g["gemini_prediction"] on
    these (typically to whatever was frozen from the previous build)
    before calling this, for a game that's already started: its pregame
    line is frozen, so there's nothing new to grade the prediction
    against, and a moving in-game line shouldn't trigger a fresh call
    anyway. This is also exactly what makes the weekly full-refresh below
    safe -- it forces a refresh for NFL/CFB's not-yet-started games only,
    since already-started/finished games are always in skip_ids by the
    time this function sees them.
