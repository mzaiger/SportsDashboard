    `("nfl", "usa_-_nfl_preseason", "nfl_-_preseason", "usa_-_nfl_-_preseason")`
    to cover regular season plus every preseason variant SharpAPI happens
    to carry that season. This exists because SharpAPI's own /leagues
    endpoint (GET /api/v1/leagues) shows preseason odds split across
    *several* differently-named leagues that look like they come from
    different upstream providers -- there's no single clean "nfl_preseason"
    id, and no way to know ahead of time which of them actually has
    DraftKings/FanDuel rows for a given week, so the safe move is to
    request all of them and merge whatever comes back. Each league id is
    fetched as its own fully-paginated request; rows from every league are
    concatenated into one list. A league that returns nothing just
    contributes zero rows -- it doesn't cause the others to fail.

    `date_from`/`date_to` (YYYY-MM-DD strings) are optional but recommended
    when the caller knows the exact date range it's building -- narrowing
    the request server-side means far fewer total rows/pages to page

    case than asking for everything currently posted and filtering
    client-side.

    observed occasionally returning a 400 on a cursor-based page request
    (e.g. right after a rate-limit wait, or on an already-large query) that
    succeeds on retry. If every attempt for a page fails, this returns
    whatever rows were already collected instead of raising -- one bad
    page for one day/request shouldn't crash the whole build; the caller
    (each build script now fetches one day at a time) just moves on to its
    next request. A 429 (rate limited) doesn't count against the retry
    budget at all -- it's an expected throttle, not a failure, so it's

# puck line is likewise effectively always fixed at +/-1.5 -- see

# inferred by analogy with SharpAPI's other two sport-specific spread
# names, not confirmed against a live response (no network access to
# SharpAPI while building this) -- if NHL's spread column comes back
# empty on the first real run, check the raw market_type strings in a
# fetch_all_odds(league="nhl") response and fix this mapping. All map
