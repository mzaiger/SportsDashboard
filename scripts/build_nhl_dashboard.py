"""
NHL Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls the day's schedule + broadcast + team records from ESPN's public
(unofficial, no-key-required) hockey scoreboard API, then attaches
DraftKings / FanDuel puck-line (spread) + moneyline odds from SharpAPI
(via common.py). Exports everything to data/nhl_dashboard.json for the
static nhl.html front-end.

Like MLB/NBA, the NHL plays most days of the week (no real "week N"
concept during the regular season), so this script -- like
build_mlb_dashboard.py / build_nba_dashboard.py -- moves one calendar day
at a time instead of one week at a time. To reuse the exact same JSON
shape and front-end/merge code CFB/NFL/MLB/NBA/NCAAMB already share
(weeks -> days -> time_slots -> games), each "week" entry in
nhl_dashboard.json actually holds exactly one calendar day, and the
"week" number is that day's date as an integer (YYYYMMDD) rather than a
real week number. See build_mlb_dashboard.py's own module docstring for
the full rationale -- this script follows it exactly.

The puck line (NHL's version of a point spread) is, like MLB's run line,
almost always fixed at +/-1.5 goals and doesn't discriminate between
games the way a football point spread does -- so, like build_mlb_
dashboard.py, the matchup score here is combined win rank ONLY, no
spread blending (unlike build_nba_dashboard.py, whose spread genuinely
varies game to game and IS blended in).

NHL records come back from ESPN as a three-part "W-L-OTL" summary (wins-
losses-overtime losses), not the two-part "W-L" NBA/MLB use -- an
overtime/shootout loss still earns a point in the standings, so ranking
teams by raw win percentage alone (ignoring OTL entirely) would
understate a team that's lost several close overtime games. This script
instead ranks by standings POINTS percentage (2 pts per win, 1 pt per
OTL, out of 2 pts possible per game), same as the NHL's own standings
formula -- see build_win_rank_lookup() below.

NOTE ON SHARPAPI'S NHL MARKET NAME: SharpAPI's spread-equivalent market
is called "run_line" for MLB and "point_spread" for football; this
script assumes NHL's is "puck_line" by analogy (added to common.py's
_SPREAD_MARKET_ALIASES), since there was no network access to SharpAPI
itself while writing this. If the spread column comes back empty on the
very first real run, check the raw market_type strings in a
fetch_all_odds(league="nhl") response and fix that mapping in common.py.

Off-season handling: if today falls BEFORE the first date on ESPN's
calendar (leagues[].calendar), the build window stays centered on real
"today" (so the Stanley Cup Final finale keeps showing) for
OFFSEASON_GRACE_DAYS after its last kickoff, then snaps forward to that
first game date -- so the board previews next season's opener instead of
sitting blank for months. See resolve_effective_today() below.
