"""
NCAAMB (Division I men's college basketball) Betting Dashboard builder.

Pulls the day's schedule + broadcast + team records from ESPN's public
(unofficial, no-key-required) men's college basketball scoreboard API,
then attaches DraftKings / FanDuel spread + moneyline odds from SharpAPI
(via common.py). Exports everything to data/ncaamb_dashboard.json for the
static ncaamb.html front-end.

Like MLB/NBA, college basketball plays near-daily once the season starts
(no real "week N" concept on a day-granularity board), so this script --
like build_mlb_dashboard.py / build_nba_dashboard.py -- moves one calendar
day at a time instead of one week at a time. Each "week" entry in
ncaamb_dashboard.json holds exactly one calendar day, and the "week"
number is that day's date as an integer (YYYYMMDD). See
build_mlb_dashboard.py's module docstring for the full rationale.

Differences from the NBA builder:
  * Only "main channel" national-TV games make the board (same idea as
    build_ncaaf_dashboard.py; ESPN sometimes packs multiple networks into
    ONE string inside a broadcast object, so names are split on "/" and
    "," before being checked against MAIN_CHANNELS). The channel set is
    wider than CFB's -- see MAIN_CHANNELS below.
  * Games are ranked with college football's three-component blend --
    50% combined AP Top 25 rank + 25% combined win-rank + 25% posted
    spread -- instead of the NBA's two-component blend, since AP rank is
    the marquee signal in college hoops the same way it is in CFB.
  * Off-season guard: if today falls before the first date on ESPN's
    calendar (leagues[].calendar), the build window snaps forward to that
    first game date so the board shows opening night instead of three
    blank days. See resolve_effective_today() below.

Env vars required:
    SHARPAPI_KEY - key from https://sharpapi.io
    (no key needed for ESPN's public scoreboard/rankings endpoints)
